# Programming in Python for Data Science

Welcome to the "Programming in Python for Data Science" course repository! This repository contains a series of tasks designed to provide practical experience in key aspects of data science using Python.

## Course Overview

The course is structured into several phases, each focusing on essential skills necessary for data analysis and manipulation.

### Task 1 and Task 2: Fundamental Python Operations

Tasks 1 and 2 familiarize students with fundamental Python operations, data structures, and functions.

### Analysis Preparation

In the Analysis Preparation phase, you will learn:
- Importing necessary libraries
- Loading and displaying data
- Examining data information

### Data Cleaning

The Data Cleaning phase covers:
- Removing redundant columns
- Renaming columns for clarity
- Eliminating duplicate rows
- Handling null values effectively
- Enhancing the dataset with new columns like HP_Type and Price_Class

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During EDA, you will explore data using techniques such as:
- Calculating mean prices
- Counting occurrences by year
- Identifying unique makes
- Assessing fuel efficiency
- Performing cross-tabulations
- Isolating and analyzing specific features
- Identifying outliers within the dataset

### Task 3: Advanced Concepts

Task 3 introduces advanced concepts including:
- Data preparation for analysis
- Defining and executing a custom Tournament class
- Comparing results across multiple executions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will gain practical skills in:
- Python programming fundamentals
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis techniques
- Advanced data manipulation and class definitions
